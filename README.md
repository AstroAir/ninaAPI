# ninaAPI
API for the astronomy imaging software N.I.N.A.
The documenation is available [here](https://github.com/christian-photo/ninaAPI/wiki)

Shoutout to tcpalmer and his [web session plugin](https://github.com/tcpalmer/nina.plugin.web/tree/main), from which I took a lot of inspiration (and a few code snippets)
